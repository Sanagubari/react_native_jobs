## About the App:

React Native jobs, is an App that consists of Job listings where job hunters can serach for jobs.The jobs are split up into categories of full time, part time, and contractor jobs, aswell as the option to filter through the jobs by search. The UI of the individual job listings is organised into 3 subsections of About, Qualifications and Responsibilites to allow the user to filter through the information and digest it easily. It also includes a button at the bottom of the page which directs the user to the job listing on the internet so that they can apply to the job if they wish to do so.
